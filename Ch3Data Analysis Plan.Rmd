### Research Questions - Primary Analyses  
The following research questions build upon work by Endedijk et al., (2015) and Brownell et al., (2006). Essentially, the present research combines the two aformentioned works and introduces the following key features: 1.) Larger sample size (Endedijk: ~63 24-month-old dyads, Brownell: 14 ~24-month-old dyads), 2.) More conservative cooperation definitions (3s allowance overlap like Brownell, but also exact/true cooperation defined by exact overlap), 3.) Explores links between early (at 12-months) cooperative understanding and later cooperative ability with a peer, 4.) Introduces parent characteristcs such as early cooperative values (measured at infant age 9-months) and Big 5 personality as potential factors to explain variability in 24-month-olds cooperative ability and cooperative social context with a peer, 5.) Considers the social context surrounding the warm up - otherwise described as first impressions/the initial interaction between a dyad (including a semi unstructured adult led "cooperative" toy tidy activity - heavily social convention based). 
  
  
#### Parent (ORCA) Analyses
  
  
* Does parent personality correlate/predict frequency of initiating and/or responding behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
  

**Hypothesis**: In previous research by Breeland & Henderson (2020) parent Agreeableness positively related to 14-month-olds spatial coordination on a parallel roles task with an adult experimenter. In this task infants generally exhibited responding behaviours, while the adult experimenter initated. Further, in adults, Agreeableness is linked with cooperation (Habashi et al., 2016; Kagel et al., 2014). It could be argued that the display of responding behaviours is more "cooperative" than initiating  behaviours because it demands that you follow the action/anticipate the action of the social partner. It is therefore hypothesized that parents high in Agreeableness will have children who engage in more responding behaviours.

* Does parent personality (ORCA parent only) correlate/predict the latency to success score for the dyad, when controlling for the actions (initiating/responding behaviour) of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: In Breeland and Henderson (2020), Parent Openness predicted infant latency to success in a complementary roles task, however these infants actually took longer to complete the goal. Theoretically (as described above), children of parents high in Agreeableness should be better at cooperating and thus achieve a shorter latency, when controlling for the behaviours of their social partner.  


#### Longitudinal + Parent (ORCA) Analyses
* Do parent cooperative values (egoistic vs altruistic, measured at infant age 9-months) predict 24-month olds initiating/responding behaviour, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
  
**Hypothesis**: Yes, in Breeland and Henderson (2020) more altruistic parents had children who were more spatially coordinated and successful in a parallel roles task with an adult experimenter. We would expect to observe this in a peer interaction as well by seeing children engage in more responding behaviours if their parent emphasizes altruism.

* Do parent cooperative values (egoistic vs altruistic, measured at infant age 9-months) predict latency to success in a parallel roles task with a peer at 24-months of age, when controlling for the cooperative behaviours of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: Yes, children of more altruistic parents will take longer to achieve the goal based on results by Breeland and Henderson (2020).

init.CVS.lat_model
summary(init.CVS.lat_model)
```
  
#### Warm Up Analyses 
To our knowledge, all of the studies investigating peer cooperation do not take into account what occurs in the "warm up phase" of studies involving child participants. This is alarming and concerning as research shows that first impressions (e.g., an individuals choice in an economic game, such as a public goods or trust game) have an effect on subsequent cooperative actions/contributions between two or more people (Engel et al., 2014; Grueneisen & Tomasello, 2017; see other literature about multi-shot economic games). The Broken Windows Theory (Wilson & Kelling, 1982) suggests that obvious signs of social disorder (e.g., graffiti or broken windows in a neighbourhood) encourages further social disorder/crime. This holds true in lab based experiments as well suggesting that the social situation (e.g., contributions to the greater good) decays if others behave selfishly and are "found out" (Engel et al., 2014). Broken Windows Theory taken together with previous research regarding multiple-shot economic games highlights the need for researchers to explore the social context that two child participants are situated in *before* completing a cooperative task. If cooperation occurs in the initial meeting aka warm up phase, surely this supports later cooperation. Alternatively, if social decay occurs within the warm up phase, research would suggest that this would hinder cooperative success in subsequent tasks. But do 2-year-olds hold grudges?  
  
*Note.* T1 = score for first 1:30, T2 = score for last 1:30, T1T2 = combined averaged score)  
  
  
#### Warm Up + Parent (ORCA) Analyses

* Does parent personality (Agreeableness) predict child (ORCA) contribution?  
**Hypothesis:** Yes, Agreeableness in adults is characterised by adherence to routines/conventions and is also related to cooperation. The mechanism of this relationship is unclear at the moment but we would expect parents Agreeableness to impact how their child acts in a sociology-normative cooperative activity like the "toy tidy"

```{r parent personality predicting contribution - ordinal log regression, include = FALSE}
dyad.df$wu_contrib_o_cat <- factor(dyad.df$wu_contrib_o, ordered = TRUE)
pp.contrib.olrm <- polr(wu_contrib_o_cat ~ big5_open_o + big5_cons_o + big5_extra_o + big5_agree_o + big5_neur_o, data = dyad.df, Hess=TRUE)

```

pp.contrib.lm <- lm(wu_contrib_o ~ big5_open_o + big5_cons_o + big5_extra_o + big5_agree_o + big5_neur_o + parent_type_p5 + pcg_p5, data = dyad.df)
summary(pp.contrib.lm)
autoplot(pp.contrib.lm)
```
  
* Does parent CVS predict child (ORCA) contribution?  
```{r}
pp.contrib.cvs.lm <- lm(wu_contrib_o ~ response.diff_o + parent_type_p5 + pcg_p5, data = dyad.df)
summary(pp.contrib.cvs.lm)
```


#### Warm Up Dyadic Analyses (APIM using SEM)
  
* Are there actor-partner effects on warm up affiliation scores (T1, T2, T1T2), robot affiliation scores and latency to success?  
**Hypothesis:** Yes - we expect the two contacts to interact and influence one another (see Broken windows Theory/citations above).  
* Are there actor-partner effects on warm up antagonism scores (T1, T2, T1T2), robot antagonism scores and latency to success?  
**Hypothesis:** Yes - we expect the two contacts to interact and influence one another (see Broken windows Theory/citations above).  
* Are there actor-partner effects on warm up contribution scores and latency to success?  
**Hypothesis:** Yes - same rationale as above
* Are there actor-partner effects on warm up affiliation (T1, T2, T1T2) initiating/responding behaviours?  
**Hypothesis:**: Yes  
* Are there actor-partner effects on warm up antagonism (T1, T2, T1T2) initiating/responding behaviours?   
**Hypothesis:** Yes  
* Are there actor-partner effects on warm up contribution and initiating/responding behaviours?  
**Hypothesis:** Yes - see above

### Research Questions - Exploratory Analyses  
This section includes analyses that we may not have strong hypotheses for (due to lack of theory or previous research) but are still important to test.  
  
* Do parent cooperative values (egoistic vs altruistic, measured at infant age 9-months) predict 24-month olds affiliative/antagonistic behaviour, when controlling for the affiliative/antagonistic behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: Perhaps parents who have more altruistic values (e.g., children should cooperate to make the world a better place), parent their children different and stress being kind to others/general altruism. It is hypothesized that these children will me more affiliative and less antagonistic to an unfamiliar peer.  
* Does parent CVS at 9 months predict child (ORCA) warm up affiliation (T1, T2, T1T2) when controlling for the peers social behaviours (affiliation/antagonism)?  
**Hypothesis:** Potentially, due to the type of measurement that CVS is - I'm not sure if we would see a strong effect, but perhaps. Parents who value cooperation for altruistic reasons may have children who are more affiliative because it helps the cooperative interaction.
* Does parent CVS at 9 months predict child (ORCA) warm up antagonism (T1, T2, T1T2) when controlling for the peers social behaviours (affiliation/antagonism)?  
**Hypothesis:** Potentially, due to the type of measurement that CVS is - I'm not sure if we would see a strong effect, but perhaps. Parents who value cooperation for altruistic reasons may have children who are less antagonistic because it helps the cooperative interaction.
* Does parent CVS at 9 months predict child (ORCA) contribution when controlling for the peers social behaviours (affiliation/antagonism/contribution)?  
**Hypothesis:** Again possibly. The contribution score is really about conventions and so it is possible that "altruistic parents" may stress the importance of getting along/contributing and may have children who are more helpful in this sense? Could these values be related to conventions?
* Does parent personality (Agreeableness) at 9 months predict child (ORCA) warm up affiliation (T1, T2, T1T2) when controlling for the peers social behaviours (affiliation/antagonism)?  
**Hypothesis:** I'm not sure that there is strong evidence for this.
* Does parent personality (Agreeableness) at 9 months predict child (ORCA) warm up antagonism (T1, T2, T1T2) when controlling for the peers social behaviours (affiliation/antagonism)?  
**Hypothesis:** Again, not sure if there is strong evidence.

### Research Questions - Follow Up Analyses  
  
So basically for this section I need to look at common correlations and determine potential mediators/moderators after I've done my primary and secondary analyses.
  
* *If a relationship emerges between child temperament and affiliative/antagonistic behaviour (see secondary analyses)* Does parent personality mediate/moderate the effect of child temperament on affiliative/antagonistic behaviours, while controlling for the affiliative/antagonistic behaviours of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: Yes, given that we expect a relationship to emerge between parent personality and child temperament, and child temperament and affiliative and antagonistic behaviour, parent personality should exhibit some effect on child displays of affiliative/antagonistic behaviours. 
* *If a relationship emerges between parent personality/temperament/initiating/responding behaviours* Does parent personality mediate or moderate the effects of child temperament on initiating and/or responding behaviour? 
**Hypothesis**:

![Simplified Moderation Model](/Users/nicholebreeland/Dropbox (Uni of Auckland)/Thesis/Parents + Peer Cooperation/Analyses/P4 Peer Robot/ParentChild_Med.png) 
  
  
* *If a relationship emerges between parent personality/temperament/initiating/responding behaviours (see secondary analyses)* Does parent personality mediate or moderate the effects of child temperament on latency to success, while controlling for the cooperative behaviours of the peer? 
**Hypothesis**: Yes, given that we expect a relationship to emerge between parent personality and child temperament, and child temperament and latency to success, parent personality should exhibit some effect on latency to success.  
* *If a relationship emerges between parent CVS and affiliative/antag behaviour and parent CVS and initiating/responding behaviours/latency to success* Does parent CVS mediate or moderate the effects the social context on child cooperative success (initiating/responding/latency).  
**Hypothesis**: Yes  

  
### Research Questions - Secondary Analyses  
  
#### Individual Level Analyses (ALL)  
  
* Does parent personality correlate/predict child temperament?  
**Hypothesis**: We expect multiple relationships to emerge. Puff & Renk (2016) 'found that mothers’ mood, flexibility, lack of distractibility related significantly to positive parenting behaviors, locus of control, high core self- evaluations, and young children’s easy temperament characteristics and lower levels of young children’s behavior problems.' Komsi et al. (2008) suggests that parent personality and child temperament develop in a bidirectional matter.

* Does age correlate latency to success?  
**Hypothesis**: Yes, a negative correlation is expected. Older children will have a shorter latency to success. (Endedijk et al., 2015)
```{r regression between age for orca and peer and latency to success}
#regression for age of peer and orca and predicting latency
age.latency <- lm(latency_3sec ~ age_p4_o + age_p4_p, data = dyad.df)
summary(age.latency)
```

```{r correlation between age difference within the dyad and latency to success}
#correlation between age difference and latency scores
agediff.latency.df <- subset(dyad.df, select = c("age_p4_diff","latency_3sec"))
agediff.latency.df <- na.omit(agediff.latency.df)
cor(agediff.latency.df, method = "spearman")
```

```{r ttest for age differences for cooperative ability behaviours}
#because many (~100) participants DONT have a latency score, a ttest is conducted to see if there is an age effect for age on if the child engaged in any initiating/responding behaviours.

#age at p4 and initiate (y/n)
t.test(indiv.df$Age_P4~indiv.df$Initiate_yn_3s)

#age at p4 and respond (y/n)
t.test(indiv.df$Age_P4~indiv.df$Respond_yn_3s)
```


* Does age correlate frequency of initiating behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: Yes, a positive correlation is expected. Older children will initiate more as a product of shorter latency (Endedijk et al., 2015). Also noted is older children will be more developed and thus have enhanced cognitive capacity - some citations in Endedijk paper, also we expect peer task monitoring to increase with age (Brownell et al., 2006)
* Does age correlate frequency of responding behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: Yes, a positive correlation is expected. Older children will respond more as a product of shorter latency (Endedijk et al., 2015). Also noted is older children will be more developed and thus have enhanced cognitive capacity - some citations in Endedijk paper, also we expect peer task monitoring to increase with age (Brownell et al., 2006)
* Do gender differences exist for frequency of initiating behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: We do not expect a gender difference to emerge as there is no theoretical reason and it hasn't been observed in previous research (see Brownell et al., 2006; Endedik et al., 2015)
* Do gender differences exist for frequency of responding behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: We do not expect a gender difference to emerge as there is no theoretical reason and it hasn't been observed in previous research (see Brownell et al., 2006; Endedik et al., 2015)
* Do gender differences exist for affiliative scores?  
**Hypothesis**: We expect a gender difference to emerge. This effect was observed in Endedijk et al. (2015). Girls may be less competitive and dominant than boys, and thus may display more affiliative behaviours throughout the task (Maccoby, 1990, as cited in Endedijk et al., 2015).
* Do gender differences exist for antagonistic scores?  
**Hypothesis**: Based on the logic above, a gender difference could emerge here with boys being more antagonistic than girls if they display far more competitive behaviours (Maccoby, 1990, as cited in Endedijk et al., 2015).  
* Do affiliation scores correlate to frequency of initiating behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: We expect that initiating behaviours will be related to cooperative success (as measured by latency and frequency of successes). Endedijk et al. (2015) and Ramani (2012) found affiliative behaviours, such as positive communication, was linked with cooperative success. Thus, we hypothesize that affiliation scores will be linked with initiating behaviours.
* Do affiliation scores correlate to frequency of responding behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: We expect that responding behaviours will be related to cooperative success (as measured by latency and frequency of successes). Endedijk et al. (2015) and Ramani (2012) found affiliative behaviours, such as positive communication, was linked with cooperative success. Thus, we hypothesize that affiliation scores will be linked with responding behaviours.
* Do antagonistic scores correlate to frequency of initiating behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: A correlation is not expected to emerge. Endedijk et al. (2015) found no relationships and suggested that it is due to the double function of antagonistic behaviours between peers. Although antagonistic behaviour can be detrimental to social function (Hart, DeWolf, Wozniak, & Burts, 1992; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2004, as cited in Endedijk et al.,2015), it can also serve as a normative function - enforcing how children should interact with one another (Vaughn, Vollenweider, Bost, & Azria-Evans, 2003; Williams et al., 2007; Williams, Ontai, & Mastergeorge, 2010, as cited in Endedijk et al., 2015).

#### Individual (ORCA) Analyses
* Does temperament correlate to affiliative behaviour?  
**Hypothesis**: It is expected that a positive relationship will emerge between affiliative behaviour and temperamental Surgency, as observed in Endedijk et al. (2015). The rationale is that children high in Surgency are less shy and more likely to engage with their peers.
* Does temperament relate to antagonistic behaviour?  
**Hypothesis**: Based on the findings from Endedijk et al. (2015) and Laible et al. (2014), it is expected that Negative Affectivity will positively relate to antagonism scores. Characteristic of Negative Affectivity are: anger, contempt, disgust, guilt, fear, and nervousness. It is possible that in an interaction with an unfamiliar peer, children high in Negative Affectivity will experience these emotions and they will manifest as antagonistic behaviours.
* Does temperament relate to initiating behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: Endedijk et al. (2015) and Laible et al. (2014) found a positive relationship between Effortful Control and cooperative success, since we expect initiating behaviours to be linked with cooperative success, it is expected that a positive relationship will emerge between initiating behaviours and temperamental Effortful Control.  
* Does temperament relate to responding behaviours, when controlling for the initiating/responding behaviour of the peer?  
**Hypothesis**: Endedijk et al. (2015) and Laible et al. (2014) found a positive relationship between Effortful Control and cooperative success, since we expect initiating behaviours to be linked with cooperative success, it is expected that a positive relationship will emerge between responding behaviours and temperamental Effortful Control. This effect may be more pronounced than initiating behaviours because a characteristic of Effortful Control is the ability to manage attention and adapt to tasks that may not be very interesting to the child. If a child is high in Effortful control, they may attend to the peer more and respond more to their handle pulls, rather than starting the pulls themselves, particularly if they are initially uninterested in the task.   
* Are there differences in initiating behaviour between parent SES "groups"  
**Hypothesis**: No difference is expected.  
* Are there differences in responding behaviour between parent SES "groups"  
**Hypothesis**: As "responding behaviour" could be considered the more "cooperative" behaviour, we may see a difference in those children who have parents in the low SES groups. Endedijk et al. (2015) found that 4 year olds who attended child care more frequently were more successful and affiliative in the cooperative task. The rationale is that perhaps parents in the lower SES category may have to work more and thus their children may spend relatively more time in childcare situations at a younger age.

*Notes*: It would be good to include covariates such as age and gender, if differences are found above. Dyads are distinguishable by longitudinal and one-off participant - the design is a standard design. Will first check for nonindependence and also conduct a power analysis.
